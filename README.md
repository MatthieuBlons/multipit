This repository provides a set of Python tools to perform multimodal learning with tabular data. It contains the code used in our study: 

"Integration of clinical, pathological, radiological, and transcriptomic data improves the prediction of first-line immunotherapy outcome in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer"

## Key features
* **Early and late fusion implementations**: 4 estimators compatible with scikit-learn and scikit-surv to fuse several tabular modalities in a single multimodal model.
  * [`multipit.multi_model.EarlyFusionClassifier`](multipit/multi_model/earlyfusion.py) and [`multipit.multi_model.LateFusionClassifier`](multipit/multi_model/latefusion.py) for binary classification.
  * [`multipit.multi_model.EarlyFusionSurvival`](multipit/multi_model/earlyfusion.py) and [`multipit.multi_model.LateFusionSurvival`](multipit/multi_model/latefusion.py) for survival prediction.
   

* **Scripts to reproduce the experiments of our study**: Scripts to perform late fusion an early fusion of clinical, radiomic, pathomic and transcriptomic features with a repeated cross-validation scheme. Scripts to compute and collect the SHAP values associated with each unimodal predictive model (see [scripts](scripts) folder).
   

* **Plotting functions and notebooks to reproduce the figures of our study**: several functions to plot and compare the performances of different multimodal combinations as well as to display feature importance with SHAP values.
  * [plot_results.ipynb](notebooks/plot_results.ipynb) 
  * [benchmark.ipynb](notebooks/benchmark.ipynb)
  * [plot_shap.ipynb](notebooks/plot_shap.ipynb)

## Deep-multipit

We also provide another Github repository, named [deep-mulitpit](https://github.com/ncaptier/deep-multipit) with a Pytorch implementation of an end-to-end integration strategy with attention weights, inspired by [Vangurie *et al*, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00416-8).

## Run scripts

Modify the configurations in `.yaml` config files (in config/ subfolder) then run the following command in your terminal:

```
python latefusion.py -c config/config_latefusion.yaml -s path/to/results/folder
```

````
python collect_shap_survival.py -c config/config_latefusion_survival.yaml -s path/to/results/folder
````

**Warning:** For Windows OS paths must be written with '\\' or '\\\' separators (instead of '/').

**Note:** In order to modify more deeply the loading of the data or the predictive pipelines, please update the `PredictionTask` class in the file [_init_scripts.py](scripts/_init_scripts.py). 

## Examples
In the [examples](examples) folder we provide a brief example on how to slightly modify the scripts and codes from our original experiments to perform multimodal learning for the prediction of Overall Survival from clinical and RNA-seq data extracted from TCGA (i.e., stage III and IV TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC samples).   

We simply updated the `PredictionTask` class in a new file [_init_scripts_tcga.py](examples/tcga_lung/_init_scripts_tcga.py) to load TGCA data and build predictive pipelines.

**Note:** clinical and transcriptomic data extracted for 201 stage III/IV TCGA patients (i.e., LUAD or LUSC) are available in the [data](data) folder.
